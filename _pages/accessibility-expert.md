The role of the Accessibility SME varies slightly depending on their role in the procurement process. Ultimately though, the guidelines and standards used should support independent varification. Furthermore, the goal of the Accessibility SME should be fundamentally to remove barriers and support the adoption of inclusive best practices.

Accessibility SMEs may be brought in to the process to write the ACR, interpret the results, and verify the findings. In places where there is not agreement, the Accessibility SME may be required to provide justification.

The goal should be a good customer experience for everyone, not simply conforming to the regulations. Section 508 should be the basis, and accessibility teams should be striving to exceed those minimum requrirements.

## Vendor

The vendor's Accessibility SME may be involved in engaging an agency and reviewing their findings. Barriers that are identified will need to be included in whatever issue tracking system the firm uses to manage their development. Barriers that have already been identified in the issue queue should be included in the OpenACR until they are included in a release.

Smaller firms may choose to write the OpenACRs with their own internal accessibility experts. This is acceptable, but software reviewed by 3rd parties will carry more weight with procurement officers. We have built the [OpenACR Editor](https://gsa.github.io/openacr-editor/) to help make this easier for smaller vendors.

The vendor is responsible for ensuring that the OpenACR is maintained in a cadence which roughly aligns with release cycles for the product or service. Software with active releases should have timely updates.

## Procurement

Organizations buying software may be producing their own OpenACRs. These may be for software that they build internally, or for digital products/services that they are seeking to buy. OpenACR is a format which can effectively relay concerns about a vendors products and services. Organizations may also wish to share OpenACR reviews that they have made with other teams. OpenACR documents can also be extended if teams which to collaborate on a review of common software. The [OpenACR Editor](https://gsa.github.io/openacr-editor/) can be used to facilitate this.

More commonly though, Accessibility SMEs will be reviewing the OpenACR documents which the Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) has collected. In this case, their experience will be required to both understand the impact that the Requiring officials (requestor) is organizing. The HTML reports will allow simple comparisons, but it will be important for the SME to evaluate the credibility of the claims for the vendor. Are the barriers sufficiently explained in the comments? Have a sufficient range of techniques been used in the evaluation for the ACR?

## Agency or Contractor

There are many digital agencices that develop VPATÂ® reports and can also develop OpenACR reports. There is no need to use the [OpenACR Editor](https://gsa.github.io/openacr-editor/) however, valid OpenACRs must validate against the schema as decribed in the [technical documentation](https://github.com/GSA/openacr/tree/main/docs).
