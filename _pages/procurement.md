Different organizations may have different definitions and termonilogy, but for larger organizations there are distinct roles involved in procurement. More information on various roles is available on [Acquisition.gov](https://www.acquisition.gov/).

## Requiring officials (requestor)

The goal of the requestor is to see that the project is sustainable, interoperable, and easier to implement for their department.

The requestor is usually the internal agency lead for the project. They will likely defer to one of the other roles to ensure that Section 508 requirements are met.

## Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO)

The goal of the PCO is to document that accessibility has been properly considred for accessibility. This emeans either evaluating conformance claims and choosing the technology that reasonably claims to be accessible or if that is an option, choosing one that meets the [best meets exceptions](https://www.section508.gov/buy/determine-ict-exceptions/#7) to avoid bid protests.

PCOs have historically looked for or asked vendors for VPATÂ® reports. The process is similar with OpenACRs, however an OpenACR can list:

- a public Git repository, which will make it easier to update
- additional people who are responsible for maintaining the reporting

OpenACRs also default to a Creative Commons license to make it easier to identify how content can be shared across the organization. If an OpenACR has a permissive license it can be confidently published on a government site for recommended vendors.

PCOs are encouraged demonstrate a preference for permissive licenses with open Git repositories in most instances. This will make it easier to for enterprise-wide evaluations.

The [Accessibility Requirements Tool (ART)](https://www.section508.gov/buy/accessibility-requirements-tool/) can support PCOs in ensuring that the proper procurement language is used.

Standard ICT Items are required to provide a [Supplemental Accessibility Report (SAR)](https://www.section508.gov/buy/request-accessibility-information/#0). The SAR provides additional information on how to better support persons with disabilities.

## Contracting Officer's Representative (COR)

CORs are responsible for seeing that the contractual needs are met. Looking at the results of the ART docuementation that was developed by the PCO, were expectations met?

A COR will want to look at the vendor's claims with the ACR that they submitted or released in their git repository. If those claims are deemed inadequate or misleading from the Accessibility SME, then they may need to engage with the vendor.

## Accessibility Subject Matter Expert (SME)

The role of the [Accessibility SME]({{ site.baseurl }}/accessibility-expert) is defined on its own page.
