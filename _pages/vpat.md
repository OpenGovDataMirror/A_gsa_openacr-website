The [Information Technology Industry Council](https://www.itic.org) built and had maintained the [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template® (VPAT®)](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat).

VPAT® Version 2.4 (February 2020) comes in four editions:

- WCAG edition - For reporting compliance to the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.
- 508 edition - For reporting compliance to the U.S. Revised Section 508 standards
- EU edition - The European edition used for reporting compliance to the EN 301 549 standard
- INT edition - The international edition used for reporting compliance to all three standards

The ITI also developed [VPAT® Training videos & slides](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat-training) which can be an important source of information.

The OpenACR format is presently based on the 508 edition version of VPAT® Version 2.4\. If a procurement opportunity calls for a VPAT®, you should be able to submit an HTML or PDF version of your OpenACR. In most cases the HTML report can either be either imported into Microsoft Word simply printed to PDF. The default HTML version will likely be the most accessible version.
