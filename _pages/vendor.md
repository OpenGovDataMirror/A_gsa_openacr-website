## Sales

ACRs are part of the sales process, but one goal of OpenACR is to move responsibility from sales to development and design. Accessibility should be built into the process of developing digital products/services, so should happen earlier in the process.

Sales teams will still be contacted for procurement opportunities and will need to ensure that the prospective clients have the ACRs that they have requested. It is important to note the version number of the product/service being considered.

If a vendor chooses to not release their OpenACR files through a public git repository, then the sales team will be contacted more regularly with requests. Note that some clients will request an version with a permissive license or a open git repository. Vendors who invest in accessibility will be benefit from sharing ACRs highlighting their work to comply.

The HTML version of the OpenACR report is the easiest to read. If you want to highlight the report on your website, it can be easily styled with an external CSS file.

## Legal

Accessibility perfection is not expected as part of Section 508\. Standards and environments change over time, particularly with devices connected to the internet. OpenACRs can be used to demonstrate that your products are getting more accessible over time. This does require a committment to making sure that accessibility is maintained, and regular reviews to see that they are meeting the current best practice.

## Developers and designers

Ideally the issue tracker will be organzied so that accessibility barriers align with the Section 508 requirements. This should allow for draft summaries to be easily pulled from the issue queue to ensure that known barriers are identified in the OpenACR. It is also important to update the OpenACR when issues have been fixed in a given release.

You will want to have the language for this reviewed by sales and possibly legal to ensure that the tone is appropriate for a prospective client. The OpenACR format can be extended to include information which ties into other systems or corporate metadata. Additional information should not break the validation of the OpenACR file, however you may not wish to share it publically.
